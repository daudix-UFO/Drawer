- "Retro Fedora" is originally wallpaper for ZorinOS by Nayam Amarshe: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/u45tck/3840x2160_zorinos_wallpapers/, he kindly provided me a .blend file, so I can make the fedora version myself.

- "X Files" don't need description, I just recreated it by taking the logo from Wikimedia.

- "Finder Pattern" is a remake of MacOS 9 Wallpaper
