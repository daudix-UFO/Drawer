- "Retro Fedora" is originally wallpaper for ZorinOS by [Nayam Amarshe](https://github.com/NayamAmarshe): https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/u45tck/3840x2160_zorinos_wallpapers, he kindly provided me a `.blend` file, so I can make the fedora version myself. Thank you!

- "X Files" don't need description, I just recreated scene from intro by taking the logo from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_X-Files_logo.svg).

- "Finder Pattern" is a remake of MacOS 9 Wallpaper.
